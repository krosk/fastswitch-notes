Ref list on draft

**benchmarks**
Made a bunch of benchmark with
* Quadrant: 
* AnTuTu: 
* RandMem:

Irregulars results with Quadrant, as I noticed that the CPU goes down and down... It is due to throttle which will scale down the frequency. Can not disable throttle in linux menu config -> I choose to scale down manually the cpu frequency.

**cpu frequency governor**  
* http://forum.brighthand.com/android-os/286992-cpu-governors-explained-credits-xda-forum.html
Default is interactive, switch between 320Mhz, 700Mhz, 920Mhz, 1200Mhz. Use userspace to limit to 920Mhz (at 1200Mhz it becomes hot).
Use:
```c
    echo userspace > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
    echo 920000 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_setspeed
```

**Quadrant i/o is useless?**  
* http://briefmobile.com/cyanogen-demonstrates-quadrants-flaws
Not really, it makes a repertory somewhere, then make some calculation on it. Curiously, we get curious results by deleting big files on ICS (200+ in score). JB (2gb loop) has stellar scores compared to ICS (16gb native).


**investigate page migration**  
```
offline page breakdown
isolate free pages = make sure they are not allocated 
scan the pfn range, if one is found, do_migrate_range:
  it is removed from the LRU while still in memory. It can be marked as active or unevictable though, depending on its location. Ie, we keep inactive ones.
  if success remove, and the page has no references, added to a page list
    see unmap_and_move() :
 * Obtain the lock on page, remove all ptes and migrate the page
 * to the newly allocated page in newpage.
      try to unmap : remove all ptes
      move to new page : 
        migrate page / migrate page copy
          basically, we replace the old _page cache index_ of the source page by the new _page cache index_ of the destination page. This is how the new page is found??
  page is replaced in the lru at the end
```

**interesting read on hypervisor**  
Comparison between okl4 and vmware mvp.
* http://www.ok-labs.com/blog/entry/vmware-mvp-how-it-works/
Content can be added in related works regarding hypervisor type 1 and type 2.

**related works** 
As well, distinguish ARM v6 and below who have no virtualization support, and ARM v7 and higher which have virt extensions.

**market share**

**About virtualization on ARM**  
Only the cortex A15 has virtualization extensions. OKL4 has started to play with the simulator provided.

**microkernel and hypervisor, differences?**  
* http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2010/papers/apsys/p19.pdf
In two words, hypervisor are a full layer between hardware and guest, and microkernel are a thinner layer.

**codezero**  
Hypervisor for arm devices. Works for galaxy nexus, theyr run concurrently 2 androids.  
Some questions: they say concurrently, one OS on one core. Does that means one OS has only one core available?  
Interesting way of handling storage! Android 0 start an nfs, Android 1 access to it via NFS. This of course requires both instances to run at the same time.  

**memory hotremove**  
One problem is that removed memory is still mapped. It seems, according to the documentation, that memory hotplug never bothers to remove the memmap of removed memory.  
* A new patch seems to be doing it. http://lwn.net/Articles/518689/

### 12/10  
**trying the power off trick to unload a system**
in omap/kernel/sys.c, the 
```c
    kernel_power_off()
        kernel_shutdown_prepare()
            blocking_notifier_call_chain()
            usermodehelper_disable()
            device_shutdown()
        disable_non_boot_cpus()
        syscore_shutdown()
        ..
        machine_power_off()
        Question is, does the machine stop here?
    depending on where it is called, it will call
    machine_halt()
        machine_shutdown()
        while(1)
```

In the otehr side, we have on the suspend (kernel/power/suspend.c):
```
    device_suspend()
    suspend_enter()
        disable_nonboot_cpu()
        disable_irqs()
        syscore_suspend()
```

It is important to keep devices in a suspended state, so we really need to do things before kernel_shutdown_prepare().
A tentative would be to use enter_state() (kernel_power_suspend.c).

The strategy would be, if it is not the initial instance, then closing an instance will return the memory to the initial instance (better would be its parent). We need can use the claim framework. 

Woops, failed. That is due to wakelocks. 

Using wakelocks skip. It works. 

Introducing a new mode: TERMINATE.   (and skip wakelocks for this mode). This is an alias of SUSPEND, but introduce one more condition.
Cleaning the instance by erasing the flag on master.
Multiple conditions to claim back memory:
* claim_instance = master_instance (terminal condition to claim memory)
* claim_count = 0 (no need)
* claim_start: use virt_to_phys(PAGE_OFFSET)
* set CMM_CLAIMED flag for each section belonging to instance
* set CMM_AVAILABLE on reclaim

Noticed that we can switch savagely! Corrected this.

Noticed that the memory reclaimed from the kernel space of OS2 is marked as not available. We correct this.

Misc: When we have an error, just skip entirely the switch, how about this?

Noticed a bug, it is when memory offline fails, the suspend will abort but if we retry it will load even if the memory is not free... This is becasue of the script. We need to make a check in the load_file!


**Timing breakdown for instance to instance**
We cheat a little here, we switch from an instance to the same instance. Timing can be done like this
```c
    start_time = jiffies;
    ... activity
    duration = jiffies - start_time;
    msec = jiffies_to_msecs(abs(duration));
    pr_info("%s took %d.%03d seconds\n", label, msec / 1000, msec % 1000);
```
It is handy to track a duration, but there is something odd: the jiffies calculated in the limbo are just... null, which means they are not accounted within the extra low level of the proceeedure. I doubt they are instantaneous...  
There is, however, a mention on Suspended for xxx seconds which seems a reliable source, see kernel/power/suspend_time.c
After reading the source, it is a time registered between the syscore suspend and the ssycore resume. We do not need to track time inside.

What we can do is from the request, to start a jiffie timer, and to report time from the beginning!


**observations**
The next opportunity to suspend. This is the major source of fluctuation. They are all due to wakelocks. 
It can be occaional delays (type 1) or hard delays (type 2). Occasional delays have timeout, and are due to hasard in Android, wifi. Hard delays are due to wakelocks without timeout, ie audio (finishes when it finishes).

Other timings are do not fluctuate so much, the most stable being the limbo (it is a hard sequence, so there is not much to change).
Was afraid that the cpuspeed fluctuation (due to the interactive governor) would change things, but it seems not.

prints reaaaally take some time...

The first time we switch, it is fast, 88 versus 238 ms. There might be some reasons behind... but the code can clearly be optimised, I think?   

Skipping wakelocks will reduce absolutely the delay part. But it will add bug messages on early device (+0.1s), and sometimes lead to a cascade fail of devices suspend. Something i did not notice before, it is the wakelock skip, it is effective for ALL instances, and is disabled each time an OS boots.  
Other bad effect is the audio. It will tear down the wifi as well, if a switch happens when there is a transfer ongoing. The network must reboot. Sometimes, the wifi will crash and reboot itself. It is much more stable if the network is the same between both instances.

Finally, I need to say that skipping wakelocks is altogether a bad idea, notably for the wifi transfers.

That was hard, but finally found the correct Latex template to use for IEEE Computer Society
* http://www.computer.org/portal/web/cscps/submission#pages

* http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/icse2012/how-to-submit/  
I think i need usletter format, and the compsocconf attribute.

### 14-16/10
Got latex working.

Finished the paper.

Nothing to say, really. Word was good for making figures and exporting them to pdf.

### 17/10
Update Android SDK

Nexus 7 lost its root. Packing a unix environment on windows with:
* https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow/wiki

Went back to Ubuntu.  

Process to root back the Nexus 7:

**Refactor code**
Noticed that in the omap kernel, the branch for ICS (android-omap-tuna-3.0-ics-mr1) has frozen. Our implementation is currently based on this branch, so there is no need to tamper with it anymore.  
I consider moving to the JB branch altogether, so it becomes the initial system.  

The branch android-omap-tuna-3.0-mr0 is not compatible with ICS, I suspect it is too new, or not adapted to the requirements of ICS (wrong binaries or whatever).

**compiling jelly bean**
It may have not happened before, but using ics defconfig makes the wifi act up (up, reset, up, reset). I copied a new def config from the previous jelly bean port, and it works, but I don't know what I changed.

The working branches with a clean dejllybean system, and a proper config, are:
* android-omap-tuna-3.0-jb-mr0, most recent version september 2012
* android-omap-tuna-3.0-jb-pre1, version june 2012 (pre-release I guess, it stopped more or less)
* android-omap-tuna-3.0-mr0(.1) deprecated (Nov 2011)
* android-omap-tuna-3.0 deprecated 2011
* android-omap-3.0 updated september 2012
From this distribution, what I see is that the tuna board has no more need of any suport, the lastest with support being the jellybean one. ICS stoppsed on April.

**Working on which next platform?**
x86 was not a bad idea: we have qemu, linaro kernels, uboot, and mostly anything possible. Wakelocks have disappeared, but still...  
I am so stupid, linaro is doing ARM only work... For x86, just get the regular kernel, ha!
Aww, forget it, I will stay on ARM, I have no time to do other things. However, I will migrate to versatile express.


**Refactor 1: initrd relocation**
Separated initrd relocation on two patchs, one handles the kernel code, the other handles the ARM specifc part.

**Refactor 2: memory hotplug**
It is a bit complicated here, sparsemem and memory hotplug are separate piece of code.  
First, we do sparsemem. 
Each sub-architecture has a ARCH_SPARSEMEM_ENABLE to indicate it supports. for OMAP4, we can do the same. Sadly, currently only tuna supports it, so it is a bit complicated to make a generality? Maybe put this on MACH_TUNA instead.

So anyway, first is to set ARCH_FLATMEM_ENABLE by default. Then add sparsemem as an option. Then add memory hotplug. support. Then ARCH_POPULATES_NODE_MAP.

By doing so, we have a proper sparsemem functional.

**refactor fastswitch**
Got a lot of work here...  
First, make a proper directory in the linux tree, called muxos.  Found that the Kconfigs work in a tree of inclusions. Only one Kconfig is launched at the beginning (arch/arm/Kconfig) then every thing is added via source, tu build the Kconfig menu. So for an architecture to support muxos, there is only the need to add 'source "muxos/Kconfig"'.

Steps:
* import the muxos header
* import the debug fs; it is something relatively stable and can be in a separate file.
* import the interface to set sections offline/online
* import pretty much anything regarding memory initialization
* import the functions to load a file
* (boot step) make the change in the decompressor head + the suspend body
* (switch step) make the relative changes
* (transfer step)
* (closing step)

And don't rewrite things! they are already done, I should just refactor, not recode the damn whole architecture...

### 18/10
**refactor**  
On architecture dependant functions, I count those:
* image_head_check: check the existence of the fsw_page, the current action, and the addresses of tags pointer and image location. Belongs to BOOT_STEP  
... to finish later, there are more urgent things.

- how those solutions are going to come to mobile devices
```

**THUTHESIS**  
is a real pain in the ass. Not compatible at all with windows, and Miktex, so... 
* https://code.google.com/p/thuthesis/

**removed packages**
No idea if they are necessary or not, but according to this link
* 
it is legal to remove ccmap, and according to this one
* 
it is okay to remove hypernat because it is already included in hyperref.

**zhmetrics and xetex and xeCJK**
This package enables the use of fonts, although it does not embed them with it. Must find a way to support chinese fonts within miktyex.
* http://miktex.org/packages/zhmetrics

Got some font troubles, wanted to use xetex which is able to use the fonts installed in the system, but that's a bit complicated again... 
```
l.52 \char_make_active:n
```

* http://docs.miktex.org/2.7/relnotes/#id678352
According to this doc, xetex is already included in miktex. The tool to use is therefore xelatex or luatex. pdflatex does not work anymore. 

Tried to update miktex. It is starting to look good. Now they report I lack the Adobe Song Std  font. Got them here:
* http://ishare.iask.sina.com.cn/f/15105086.html 

Got also a problem of 
```
xeCJK error: "key-unknown"
```
And no solutions yet.
* http://www3.newsmth.net/nForum/#!article/TeX/313232
I ended up editing thuthesis.cls, looking for ItalicFont and changing to SlantFont.

Trying to enable xeCJK separately.
* http://ftp.ctex.org/mirrors/CTAN/macros/xetex/latex/xecjk/xeCJK.pdf
So curiously, the Adobe fonts did not work. I replaced them by SimSun, SimHei, FangSong in thuthesis.cls and finally i've got some words on pdf! 
Damn. Anyway, in page 9 of the previous pdf, here is the equivalent between the chinese name and the name in English. 

### 19/10
**Working with THUthesis**
Started an initial draft, putting the plan inside. Planning to start a git repo... why not?

### 22/10
**Separated the notes**
They were getting very slow to edit...

**Revised plan**
Our project has the difficulty of distinguishing design and implementation. Both are tied together, because I rely on Linux centric features to design how things are going to be. 

The current paper has this structure:
```
Architecture
    Principles
        Execution priority
        Device state conservation
        Usage flexibility
    CPU and Execution state
    Physical Memory
    Devices
    Storage
    Isolation
Implementation of key features
    Implementation overview
    Booting OS
    Switching OS
    Transferring memory
    Exiting OS
Evaluation
    Usability
    Performance
    Timing
    Power Consumption
Conclusion
```

A rough silu of how MuxOS has been designed, with the incremental changes:
* All OS are on RAM. Because it is good, and quick to go from one to another, and avoid transfer time if we do OS migration.
* a) One OS has full control of the hardware, the other OSes sleep. Because one user can use everything on the platform without limitations. 
* b) Of course, must be able to go from one to another OS, and not lose the OS state + device state.
* How to do a) and b)? (implementation?) Use of suspend-to-ram to suspend the others OS. We are able to switch from one to another like this, but we can't test it yet.
* Many operations to do, many values to keep: we decided to reserve a common memory accesible to all instances, called FSW_PAGE, and its structure changed during the work.

Booting up a new kernel (static memory):  
* Moving a kernel to another start address requires to provide mem arguments and add PHYS_TO_VIRT patch.
* We started by setting up a static physical memory layout (dividing the RAM by two) and compiling two distinct kernels.
* Booting up a new kernel requires to load the initrd, the zImage, and prepare some ATAGS. Used the /dev/mem interface, and copied the data to arbitrary addresses (initrd must conform to the kernel boot args, for example). NOTE: we can do something dynamic here, actually, by altering the ATAGS.
* Then we made a trampoline code at the end of suspend by making a warm-reset. This is because the second kernel requires an initialized environment.
* It is also necessary to add a trampoline code in the decompressor head, to jump to the second kernel. The target address has been retrieved from FSW.
* There are some impact on initial kernel:
* a) Since the bootloader will reload, the first kernel must reserve the modified zones (including zImage, initrd, bootloader, atags, ...). Those zones were detected beforehand by making a copy of the system and comparing the copy with the original (overwritten by bootloader).
* b) This problem forces us to relocate initrd, since it gets extracted in place and gets rewritten in the process. zImage does not get extracted in place, so it is ok.
* c) The state of the first OS is saved on SAR, but we did not backup it: solved at the next step.

Switching instances:
* The suspend path has been altered, in order to check whether a switch order has been issued or not. Some code make checks before and after the suspend and resume.
* The code to switch has been placed at the very beginning of the resume path (placed here because the MMU is disabled on this location). This includes code to backup the source context (SAR RAM content) into FSW, replace it by the destination context, and jump to the first instance resume address. The backup and retrieve are done from FSW.
* This of course requires to know what is the jump address. It is omap4_cpu_resume on our case, and we need to register it in FSW as well.
* 

* However, that does not answer how we plan to share RAM.
