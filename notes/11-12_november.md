Worked on thesis

### 16/11
**Continue refactoring code** 
global guidelines: add the debugfs first, to make sure the infrastructure is seen...

Various facts:
* printk is included with <linux/kernel.h> 
* we have our header in /muxos, and to make it accessible via an #include <file>, that would require to put /muxos in the "system dir list", OR put the header in the /include directory, it works as well 
* in git rebase, to edit a commit message only, use reword instead of edit+commit+rebase 
* #define pr_fmt(fmt) "prefix: " fmt, define it first in a file: make things so much easier! 
* A process to edit and include changes in previous commit: edit, stash, rebase, git stash apply, checkout files not involved, commit amend, rebase, stash pop 
* vi replace all: :%s/OLD/NEW/g 
* in a header file, a function is either static of extern. no keywords will add an implicit extern for functions. (not the case for variables)
* split the external api in one header, and internal functions across multiple files in another header

### 17/11 
**Various notes:** 
* put muxos_internal.h as a local file
* don't bother with a muxos repertory in include... we put it in linux.
* Maybe make one debugfs per file, with the relevant operations within the file? yes, that could a better solution instead of scattering the functions all over

**reimplementation step** 
First, the booting operation.
We first need to free memory in cascade. That means:
* (0) base address of the Muxpage, size (global.h)
* (0) helpers to block memory (any kind) (in core.c, global.h)
* (0') put init to its real location and the blocking memory functions in tuna
* TEST, check if memory of the muxpage has been removed well
* (1) muxpage global struct
* (1) function to retrieve the instance number p5 (core), add to init
* TEST, check if the muxpage can be read, and if the value has been set correctly
* (2) CST definition and struct (global.h), including AVAILABLE, OWNER_MASK
* (2) function to initialize the CST p5 (cst.c), add to init
* (2) the debugfs interface to print the CST (cst.c, interface.c)
* TEST, verify the state of CST
* (3) add strict onlining and offlining section p3 (cst.c, internal.h)
* TEST, verify if function get offlined or onlined correctly
* (4) the debugfs interface to free memory, update CST and add RST p3-4(interface.c for the args treatment, cst.c for the function)
* TEST, verify that the function offlines the correct number, and add a rst at the correct location with the correct values
* (5) add the load_file tool (tool.c, internal.h)
* (5) add the debugfs interface + function to load whatever file and update the muxpage (interface.c)
* (5)  (interface.c)

* yada yada, load file, load atags (arch dependant), suspend request


**reverse ssh** 
```
lab: ssh -R 5678:localhost:22 -p 4567 krosk@ip
sushe: ssh -X yuhe@localhost -p 5678
```
Don't forget to redirect the port 4567 in vbox



Simultaneously try on realview or exynos?
