Worked on thesis

### 16/11
**Continue refactoring code** 
global guidelines: add the debugfs first, to make sure the infrastructure is seen...

Various facts:
* printk is included with <linux/kernel.h> 
* we have our header in /muxos, and to make it accessible via an #include <file>, that would require to put /muxos in the "system dir list", OR put the header in the /include directory, it works as well 
* in git rebase, to edit a commit message only, use reword instead of edit+commit+rebase 
* #define pr_fmt(fmt) "prefix: " fmt, define it first in a file: make things so much easier! 
* A process to edit and include changes in previous commit: edit, stash, rebase, git stash apply, checkout files not involved, commit amend, rebase, stash pop 
* vi replace all: :%s/OLD/NEW/g 
* in a header file, a function is either static of extern. no keywords will add an implicit extern for functions. (not the case for variables)
* split the external api in one header, and internal functions across multiple files in another header

### 17/11 
**Various notes:** 
* put muxos_internal.h as a local file
* don't bother with a muxos repertory in include... we put it in linux.
* Maybe make one debugfs per file, with the relevant operations within the file? yes, that could a better solution instead of scattering the functions all over

**reimplementation step** 
First, the booting operation.
We first need to free memory in cascade. That means:
* (0) base address of the Muxpage, size (global.h)
* (0) helpers to block memory (any kind) (in core.c, global.h)
* (0') put init to its real location and the blocking memory functions in tuna
* TEST, check if memory of the muxpage has been removed well
* (1) muxpage global struct
* (1) function to retrieve the instance number p5 (core), add to init
* TEST, check if the muxpage can be read, and if the value has been set correctly
* (2) CST definition and struct (global.h), including AVAILABLE, OWNER_MASK
* (2) function to initialize the CST p5 (memory.c), add to init
* (2) the debugfs interface to print the CST (memory.c)
* (2') block memory for the CST, + set shared a few sections during initialization.
* TEST, verify the state of CST
* (3) add strict onlining and offlining section p3 (memory.c, internal.h)
* TEST, verify if section get offlined or onlined correctly with function
* (4) the debugfs interface to free memory, update CST, (don't add RST) p3-4(memory.c)
* TEST, verify that the function offlines the correct number
* (5) add the load_file tool (tool.c, internal.h)
* (5) add the debugfs interface + function to load whatever file and update the muxpage of target if it is kernel image and initrd p2 (core.c)
* TEST, check if all files are at the correct place


**reverse ssh** 
```
lab: ssh -R 5678:localhost:22 -p 4567 krosk@ip
sushe: ssh -X yuhe@localhost -p 5678
```
Don't forget to redirect the port 4567 in vbox

Simultaneously try on realview or exynos?

### 18/11 
* (6') get the atags related code up and working in a muxos_arm.c p6 p2 (may need to edit makefile).
* (6) debugfs to add them + arch-independant operations
TEST, check if they are properly written too
* (7) debugfs to issue the boot order and update the muxpages when loading (core.c)
* (7) code support in the suspend operation to change the flags p10
TEST, check if muxpage flags are edited
* (8') add the code to handle the switchboot order, MMU disable, but no platform reset, p7 p8
TEST, if the special code gets executed only on a switch-boot order
* (9) add the header modification for arm p1 (head.S)
* (9') add the reset code (sleep.S)
TEST, if the second instance boots on reset
* (10) add the code to add the RST, read the RST in init + update cst p5 (cst.c)
TEST, check if the sections get updated correctly
* (11') add the code to reload the backup (core.c / arm.c)
* (11) add the code to handle the suspendswitch order p7 p8 (suspend.c)
TEST, check if the suspend suceeds or not

### 19/11
**Administration**
* the advisor must be set by the jiaoxueban, not the student
* mails sent by administration were in the spam...
* the result of the anti-plagiarism check is on the advisor

**observation on linux header structure**
* we need to define specific values for one board, it is arch dependant and therefore must be put in mach directories.
* the include directories work by layer, one on top of another. the generic layer, then the arch layer, then the plat/mach layer.
* On ARM, <asm/...h> will point to arch/arm/include/asm/. <mach/...h> will point to arch/arm/machxxx/include/mach/.
* we decide to put it in a file called <mach/muxos.h>, which is the deepest we can go. plat could work as well, but mach is one step deeper.
* if no muxos.h has been placed on a target, then it will not work.

**reimplementation**
* 0 to 3
* for the free_memboot command, an attempt to set a section claimed, but not orphan

**meet again a problem in freeboot**
* offlining several sections in a row via the freeboot will trigger a page error

**check the following things:**
* reduce the timeout (no)
* print the values directly in remove memory (u64) (done)
* offline one by one all sections, in both order to see if it is a static problem (yes)
* offline via a hard-coded sequence

### 21/11
**observations on offline impossibility**
* The bug happens at section 0x9400-0x9500 or 0x9500-0x9600, when all sections below have been freed.
* It has nothing to do with free_memboot, it happens as well when sectiosn are manually disabled
* It has nothing to do with the offline timeout
* Bug happens after a certain number of sections have been offlined (5 to 6), regardless of the order, even if it is not consecutive.

This may mean that the memory hotplug has not been implemented well?

```

After some source inspection, I remember this bug: it is a bug with HOLES_IN_ZONE, encountered the 30/08. The issue is that the kernel checks whether the start of the range we free is in the same zone of the end of the range. It happened before for a certain kernel.

Anyway, HOLES_IN_ZONE must be enabled.

**right margin in edition** 
Linux has a coding style of a 80 column margin. Best is to respect this margin. 
* In vi, use:
```
:set colorcolumn=80
```

**reimplementation**
* 4, 5, 6, 7

**thoughts about atags**
Muxos expose only and only one recipient, in the muxos page. A temporary recipient, if needed, is the initiative of the architecture. For arm, it is necessary because the atags are not available so soon.

Muxos will call a backup(size, location) where a arch dependant function will fill the muxos page recipient.

For arch dependant code, we use muxos_$(ARCH).c.
